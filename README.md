## 🎯 The Mission

Our goal is simple: to create a seamless, stress-free academic experience. This app isn't just a timetable; it's your personal university assistant, ensuring you're always in the right place at the right time. This project is proudly developed for the **CPM 22503: PROJECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS** course.

* 👤 **Your Personal Hub:** Create a secure profile linked to your university ID. Manage your courses, department, and academic year all in one place.
* 🗓️ **The Intelligent Timetable:** Say goodbye to manual scheduling! Get an automatically generated timetable that updates in real-time. View your day, week, or month at a glance.
* 🔔 **Smart Alerts & Notifications:** Receive timely reminders 15-30 minutes before class. Get instant push notifications about cancellations, room changes, or important university news.
* 🔍 **Find Anything, Instantly:** A powerful search engine to find courses, locate lecturers, or pinpoint classrooms in seconds.
